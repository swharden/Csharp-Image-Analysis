# Csharp Image Analysis

**This repository contains notes and code related to quantitative analysis and transformation of scientific images using pure C#.**

There are many useful image analysis and transformation libraries available for .NET (links below). The primary goal of this repository is to organize code samples and notes for educational purposes. A secondary goal of this repository is to collect useful image manipulation and analysis code in one place under a MIT license so developers can copy/paste what they need without taking on a large framework or sticky license.

## Resources

### Software
* [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) - [Processing Image Operations](https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp/processing.html)
* [AForge.NET - Image Processing samples](http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/samples/image_processing.html)
* [CSharpImageLibrary](https://github.com/KFreon/CSharpImageLibrary) - No longer maintained. Image processing library written entirely in C# and Nuget Packages. Looks like it focuses largely on obscure format IO.
* [ImageProcessor](https://imageprocessor.org/) - Same author as ImageSharp, and not recommended for use because it does not and will not support modern .NET platforms. Its source code may be useful to review though.
* [Emgu CV](https://www.emgu.com/) - A cross platform .Net wrapper to the OpenCV image processing library.
