# Csharp Image Analysis

**This repository contains notes and code related to image transformation and analysis using pure C#.** 

The primary goal of this repository is to organize code samples and notes for educational purposes. A secondary goal of this repository is to collect useful image manipulation and analysis code in one place under a MIT license so developers can copy/paste what they need without taking on a large framework or sticky license. 

## Example Operations

Code that generated these images is in the test project.

### Blur and Sharpen

* [CSharpImageLibrary](https://github.com/KFreon/CSharpImageLibrary) - No longer maintained. Image processing library written entirely in C# and Nuget Packages. Looks like it focuses largely on obscure format IO.
* [ImageProcessor](https://imageprocessor.org/) - Same author as ImageSharp, and not recommended for use because it does not and will not support modern .NET platforms. Its source code may be useful to review though.
* [Emgu CV](https://www.emgu.com/) - A cross platform .Net wrapper to the OpenCV image processing library.
